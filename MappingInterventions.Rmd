# The exercise
We have been reading and learning about "compartment" epidemic models (i.e., the S[E]IR-type models), but they can seem a bit abstract. So let's try to make things a bit more concrete. 

I will posit that any intervention we might want to make to minimize or prevent an epidemic can be mapped on to a term describing the gains and losses of infections in a population. Here is that equation, which is really the heart of the model, with all of the terms expanded: 


$$
\frac{dI}{dt} = c(N) \frac{I}{N}  \pi S -  \phi \gamma I - (1-\phi) \gamma I
$$

Recall the meaning of the terms:

*   $c(N)$ is the contact rate between individuals, which may be some function of host number or density ($N$)
*  $I/N$ is the proportion of (randomly made) contacts that are with infectious individuals, which is the number or density of infected individuals ($I$) out of the whole population ($N$)
*  $\pi$ is the probability one of those contacts with an infectious individual leads to transmission
*  $S$ is the number or density of susceptibles making all of these potentially infectious contacts
*  $\gamma$ is the rate at which infections end, and so $1/\gamma$ is the average length of the infectious period
*  $\phi$ is the proportion of infected hosts that die, and so $1-\phi$ is the proportion that survive and recover

\newpage

These are the interventions I would like you to consider:

*  Vaccination with an immunizing vaccine
*  Vaccination with a vaccine that reduces severity of disease, but does not prevent infections and only reduces infectiousness a bit
*  Contact tracing & quarantining those who had potentially infectious contacts
*  Isolating^[Yes, isolation is for those known to be infected, quarantine is for those who might _become_ infected] those testing positive for infection
*  Social distancing (i.e., reducing close contacts)
*  Mask wearing (i.e., reducing the amount of airborne pathogen particles exhaled by an infected or inhaled by a susceptible, or the distance those particles move)
*  Providing convalescent serum to those with severe cases
*  Providing Tamiful to those testing positive
*  Hand washing

For each of these interventions I would like you to determine which term(s) it is working on.

Which are the purview of doctors vs. public health officials? Are there other patterns or ways to group interventions?
